Computer Science 230 at Uvic - assignments coded in AVR assembly and C, using Arduino AT-mega 2560 hardware.

All code and comments in labeled "Student Code" sections are my own work. All other sections in assignment files were provided. Credit to Professor Michael Zastre at Uvic for assignment files.
