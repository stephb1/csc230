# Computer Architecture
Computer Science 230 at Uvic - assignments coded in AVR assembly and C, using Arduino AT-mega 2560 hardware. This course explored memory and computer architecture design, and furthered my understanding of computer operating systems, memory, cache, storage techniques, hardware design, as well as low-level and high-level programming languages.

All code and comments in labeled "Student Code" sections are my own work. All other sections in assignment files were provided. Credit to Professor Zastre at Uvic for assignment files.
